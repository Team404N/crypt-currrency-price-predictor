# Cryptocurrency Price Predictor

## âœ… Overview

**Project Name:** Cryptocurrency Price Predictor  
**Purpose:** Predict future prices of selected cryptocurrencies using LSTM-based neural network models â€” helps users/investors forecast trends and make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“š Problem Statement

What problem are you trying to solve?  
- Cryptocurrencies are volatile; predicting prices can help in risk management.  
- Youâ€™re building a model to forecast future price movements using historical data and technical indicators.  

## ðŸ§± Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Data collection & preprocessing:** Describe where you get data (APIs, CSV), how cleaned, features.  
- **Model:** LSTM (or other), what layers, hyperparameters, etc.  
- **Environment:** Python version, dependencies (list them or refer to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`)  
- **Tools:** Any libraries (TensorFlow / PyTorch / sklearn / numpy / pandas etc.).  

## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://code.swecha.org/Abhinay29/cryptocurrency-price-predictor.git
   cd cryptocurrency-price-predictor
